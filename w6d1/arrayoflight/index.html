 <title>Array of Light</title>
</head>

<body>
 <p>
   Write a function arrayOfLight(x) (get it? Lighthouseâ€¦? Come on!) which takes one parameter, a positive number, and returns an array containing all numbers from 0 up to and including the given number.
 </p>
 <p>
   Example: arrayOfLight(5) should return [0,1,2,3,4,5]
 </p>
 <p>  
   Tips:

   An empty array can be created by simply typing [].
   Adding values to an array can be done by assigning a value to an index directly via the = operator.
